## What I found interesting

This article talks about the recent policy changes Unity imposed on their game engine. The policy essentially charges developers a fee every single time an installation of their game occurs. This especially hurts indie game companies that built their games using this supposed free engine. Many game companies are already opting to stop building games in unity and deleting their previous titles made with this engine. The recent outrage lead to many speculations including possible insider trading as executives at Unity have been selling their shares a year before this announcement causing their stock prices to plummet.
