## What I found interesting

This article talks about the recent policy changes Unity imposed on their game engine. The policy essentially charges developers a fee every single time an installation of their game occurs. This especially hurts indie game companies that built their games using this supposed free engine. Many game companies are already opting to stop building games in unity and deleting their previous titles made with this engine. The recent outrage lead to many speculations including possible insider trading as executives at Unity have been selling their shares a year before this announcement causing their stock prices to plummet.

## Comments

What's worse is that Unity is being very secretive about how the policy actually works. It's an insane business model to have installation fees as a means of getting revenue in the first place, even Unreal simply uses revenue share as it's method, but becuase it's unclear how Unity Runtime Fee will act around issues like piracy, it makes it seem like Unity Technologies is being greedy. Not to mention the rumors that there is insider trading happening behind the scenes. Many of the developers' trust in the company is waning but even still, game developers aren't really left with a good alternative to Unity. It was the backbone of medium sized game to small 3D game projects, and none of it's competitors really come close to being able to fill Unity's role in the industry. - Allyson
